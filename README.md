# GritMarket
_A website that aims to provide a secure online platform for UMBC students to sell items._
The GritMarketplace product was intended to improve the current state of item exchange and sale of college students on campuses. There are several existing marketplaces at UMBC that we found to be inefficient and pose potential security risks. GritMarketplace aims to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for UMBC students to buy and sell items. 

By offering a central hub for item listings, GritMarketplace empowers students to easily find and connect with potential buyers or sellers within the UMBC community. This connection to the community is vital to the safety of the product users. Ultimately, GritMarketplace seeks to enhance the overall student experience by providing a convenient and reliable solution for managing personal belongings and generating additional income.
