    <p>To avoid scams, the Grit Marketplace team highly suggests that you meet with sellers in-person on public UMBC campus locations such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Commons building</li>
      <li>University Center</li>
      <li>Academic Building</li>
      <li>Library</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>Meeting in-person allows you to verify that items are legitimate.</p>
  
    <p>Do not provide or accept payments before meeting in person.</p>
  
    <p>Report possible scams to the Grit Marketplace support center.</p></div>
